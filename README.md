# Numerical-Analysis

In this repository you can find my implementation of the practices and exams of other years of the subject Numerical Methods I, in this repository you can find the implementation of algorithms such as the Regula-Falsi, Newton's algorithm that can be used to find roots of functions. 

You can also find solutions to different practical exams from previous years. If you see any errors feel free to open a pull request or contact me to fix them.
